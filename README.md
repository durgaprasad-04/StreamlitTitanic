# StreamlitTitanic
 
This repository contains a machine learning web application that predicts Titanic survival using the XGBoost model. The application is built using Python and deployed with Streamlit. It utilize scikit-learn, Pandas, and Numpy for data preprocessing, model building, and predictions.

**Features**
Preprocessing of the Titanic dataset (handling missing values, feature engineering)
Training an XGBoost model to predict survival
Interactive web app for making predictions on new data
Visualization of the prediction results
**Technologies Used**
XGBoost: For model training and predictions
Streamlit: For building and deploying the web app
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing
Numpy: For numerical computations
scikit-learn: For handling pipelines, transformers, and preprocessing
